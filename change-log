## Version 7.0.0 (2025-02-16)

### New Features

- A drop-down option (multi-select option) provides the ability to create a cell that contains multiple selectable values.`sheet`->`[n]`->`dropDowns`
- The `replaceInExcel` functionality in Excel allows you to replace data in an existing file using flags provided within the spreadsheet.

### Bug Fixes

- `generateExcel` supports empty objects and will generate an empty Excel file.

> [!NOTE]  
> The related interface has not changed, so the sheet needs to be provided in TypeScript.

### Improvements

- Begin adding JSDoc comments to the main functions and interfaces.
